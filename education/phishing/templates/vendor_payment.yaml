  Hi {recipient_name},

  Quick heads up - we've changed banks and need to update our payment information
  in your accounts payable system ASAP.

  Please update our banking details for all future payments:

  Previous Bank: Wells Fargo
  New Bank: First Internet Bank

  New Account Number: 8472910384
  New Routing Number: 042000314
  Swift Code: FIBKUS44

  Please confirm you've made this update. We have several outstanding invoices
  that need to be paid to the new account.

  Thanks for your quick action on this!
